The code starts with <!DOCTYPE html> which defines it as an HTML5 document.

Inside <head>, metadata and CSS styles are included to make the form look neat.

The <body> contains a centered form styled as a booking box.

A heading <h2> displays “Room Booking” at the top.

Labels and input fields collect user details like name, email, and phone.

Date inputs (<input type="date">) let the user select check-in and check-out dates.

A dropdown <select> allows the user to choose the room type (single, double, suite).

A number input collects how many guests will stay.

A “Book Now” button submits the form data.

Currently, this form is only frontend—backend is needed to save or process bookings.
